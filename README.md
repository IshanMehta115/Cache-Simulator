# Cache Simulator

This cache simulator project allows you to simulate cache behavior using different mapping techniques: direct mapping, associative memory, and n-way set associative memory.

## Features

- Supports loading data into the cache using various cache mapping techniques
- Provides a search functionality to check if data exists in the cache
- Allows the user to specify the cache mapping technique and associativity level (n) at runtime

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/IshanMehta115/Cache-Simulator.git`

2. Build and run the cache simulator program.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the cache mapping technique and associativity level (n).

4. Load data into the cache using the on-screen instructions.

5. Search for data in the cache using the on-screen instructions.

## Configuration

The cache simulator supports different cache mapping techniques based on user input. You can choose the desired mapping technique and associativity level (n) at runtime.
